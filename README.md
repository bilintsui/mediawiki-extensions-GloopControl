## GloopControl
This extension provides various utilities for staff to use on Weird Gloop wikis, on a special page called `Special:GloopControl`. A lot of the functionality included in this extension won't make sense when used outside a Weird Gloop wiki.

Permanent, usually hook-based, tweaks that are specific to Weird Gloop wikis should instead be added to the [GloopTweaks extension](https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-GloopTweaks).

This extension adds one right, `gloopcontrol`, which should be granted to the `staff` user group in the MediaWiki config. The extension does not automatically grant the right to any user group by default.
